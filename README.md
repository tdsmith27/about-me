# About Me
I’m currently seeking my next challenge, so I suspect most viewers of this profile will be recruiters or potential employers, and thus I've made this readme to serve as the entry point to viewing my github portfolio. I think each of the apps on display here says something about the kind of engineer and problem solver I am.

These apps all use a Javascript tech stack, including Node.js, React.js, Express, and various other front-end and back-end frameworks and libraries. I’m including apps that use both SQL and noSQL databases (I'm comfortable with both--my SQL experience is with mySQL and postgreSQL; noSQL is with MongoDB). Each of these apps have been deployed using AWS EC2, but some of the apps were built with continued education in mind (as opposed to public consumption) so they may not be live at the time of your viewing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this message and to view these apps. I am passionate about my work, and enjoy the problem solving process inherent in software development, but most importantly I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and developing my skills. I am driven by a challenge, and I enjoy the continual opportunity for growth provided by this rapidly changing industry, and I look forward to the opportunity to join a team soon.
